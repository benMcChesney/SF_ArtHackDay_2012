based off of ofxKinect by Theo Watson + Other : github.com/ofxKinect

This is a tool to project over simple openCV object by calibrating and cropping the kinect space to the projector space.

Toggle the GUI off with 'g'
with the GUI off draw the square rectangle ( it will turn yellow ) that's the area of the projector screen
Toggling 'f' will bring the app into fullscreen mode and scale the yellow square's openCV blobs to fit the screen

**Still very much in development
